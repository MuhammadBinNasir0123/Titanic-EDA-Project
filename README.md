# Titanic-EDA-Project 🚢  

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to uncover key insights about the passengers, survival rates, and patterns within the data.  

---

## 📊 Project Overview  

- Perform data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, etc.)  
- Explore survival patterns across gender, age, class, and family size  
- Generate insights that could help build predictive models  

---

## 🗂️ Dataset  

The dataset used is the Titanic Passenger Dataset (available on Kaggle).  

- `titanic_cleaned.csv` → final cleaned dataset used for analysis  

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries  

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- PyCharm

## 📈 Key Insights  

- Women had a higher survival rate compared to men  
- First-class passengers survived more than third-class passengers  
- Women in the first class had the greatest chance of survival (96.8%)  
- Men in the third class had the lowest chance of survival (13.5%)
