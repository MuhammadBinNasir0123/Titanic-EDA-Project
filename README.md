#  Titanic EDA Project  

An exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **Titanic Passenger Dataset** to uncover survival patterns and key insights that can support predictive modeling.  

---

##  Project Overview  

This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset with the aim of:  
- Cleaning and preparing the raw passenger data  
- Exploring survival rates across **gender, age, class, and family size**  
- Highlighting patterns that explain who had a better chance of survival

##  Dataset  

- Source: **Kaggle Titanic Passenger Dataset**  
- Files:  
  - `Titanic-cleaned.csv` → final cleaned dataset used in analysis  

---

##  Tools & Libraries  

- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Environment:** PyCharm  

---

##  Key Insights  

- **Women survived at higher rates** compared to men  
- **First-class passengers** had a significantly higher survival rate than third-class  
- **Women in first class** had the greatest survival chance (**96.8%**)  
- **Men in third class** had the lowest survival chance (**13.5%**)
