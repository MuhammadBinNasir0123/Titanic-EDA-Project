# titanic-eda-project

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to uncover key insights about the passengers, survival rates, and patterns within the data.

📊 Project Overview
•Perform data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates, etc.)
•Explore survival patterns across gender, age, class, and family size
•Generate insights that could help build predictive models

🗂️ Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic Passenger Dataset (available on Kaggle).
titanic_cleaned.csv → final cleaned dataset used for analysis

⚙️ Tools & Libraries
•Python (Pandas, NumPy)
•Matplotlib, Seaborn
•PyCharm

📈 Key Insights
•Women had a higher survival rate compared to men
•First-class passengers survived more than third-class passengers
•Women in the first class had the greatest chance of survival (96.8%)
•Men in the third class had the lowest chance of survival (13.5%)
